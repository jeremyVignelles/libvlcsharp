### Getting started on LibVLCSharp for Linux

1. Install **[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin)**. Make sure you can invoke it using `msbuild`.
2. Install **libvlc**: 
> `apt-get install libvlc-dev`. 

*`libvlc.so` and `libvlccore.so` need to be located at `/usr/lib`.*

3. Install **gtksharp** (or monodevelop which uses it)
> `apt-get install gtk-sharp2`
